## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
- Their was a lot that resonated with me from the video, firstly the point she made about struggling and feeling like something is not for you really hit home because when she said "struggling actually means your learnings" I felt that. The reason is because now that I step back and look at my progress I see I have gained some skill/knowledge since I have started. I may not be where I want but I know if I keep practicing and keep learning from my mistakes I will get better.The second thing that resonated with me is the fact I cant compare myself to anyone else. Sometimes I find myself comparing and not in a jealous way but more of a way like how is he that good already or dang he is smarter/better, when in reality he/she does indeed have more experience with these subject matters and I cant compare myself because it does no good for moving forward and getting better.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
- I currently demonstrate a growth mindset by not quitting and by going out of my comfort zone too find answers. Ways I do not demonstrate it is when I sit in frustration about something I need to just slow down and break the problem down and find a solution.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
- I believe they use arrays on shoe websites and apps to show you different brands of shoes.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
- An array methods are just functions that cab be used on certain objects.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
- The purpose of a loop is to perform repeated tasks based on a condition.
- If you wanted to iterate over all the objects using a loop in conjunction with an array would be good , you don't want to use a loop to iterate over elements.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
- A loop is like putting all your toys in a toy box 1 at a time until you finally don't have any toys to put in!

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
- Im still a little confused on how to use an array with a loop.
