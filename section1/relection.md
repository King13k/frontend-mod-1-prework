## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
/ After reading the first thing came to mind to me was that i'm no a super learner. So the actions I will take to become a super learner are as follows!
1. I will try my best to read more because I haven't read a book in a while.
2. I will try to commit to eating more vegetables even though I don't quite like them.
3. The final thing I will do is work on changing the way I view learning.


2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

# Data Types
- String, This dataType is words and other characters put together within quotes. You may use single or double quotes but they must be the same.
- Number, This dataType handles numbers.
- Boolean, This dataType can only have one of two values and that is True or False.

## Log To The console!

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

var name = "Hello World"
console.log(name)

## Comments in JavaScript

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// When you place those 2 slashes everything the the right of them are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter.
// You would leave a comment to explain code and to make your code more readable.

## What is a Variable?

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
- A variable is a name of a storage system location.


6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
- Instagram uses string dataType, and also number dataType if you buy something on the app.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
- Concatenation just means "join together"

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
- I think they could use them on social media apps to create ads.

## Question

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
- When writing code  should you always leave a comment explaining your code? Or is that not common.
