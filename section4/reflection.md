## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

- It went better still trying to get a bit better at it!

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

- It was a for sure eye opener for me. I believe it helps but I also need to figure out my workflow still.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?





1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
   - array would be the way to store the names because its a List.
  * List of states and their capitals
   - Object because each state would store the city.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
   - Object because list will store the things you need to pack.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
   - Array because your not storing anything.
  * List of student names and their cohort
   - Object because your storing the cohort within each name.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
   Object because you are storing the amount of each ingredient.
  * All my favorite restaurants
  - Object because you would be the object and the restaurants would be stored in you.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? n/a

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

Still need to do research seeing how I can't quite grasp it.
