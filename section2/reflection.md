## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?
- I feel Like I ask too many questions, Its kind of how I learn but I feel I need to get better at researching.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
- It was uncomfortable and I think the most uncomfortable part about it was talking to someone in the class that really had a grasp on it already and I couldn't catch my wave....with that it has pushed me to really strive to be a better researcher!

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
- A conditional statement is a way for the computer to handle decisions

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
- When a program is reading a 'if' statement it is trying to find the line of code that execute statement,
if it reads a line and it doesn't execute the statement it goes to the 'if' statement and if that 'if' statement executes then the line ends there.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
- I would use OR "||", AND "&&" to check if 2 conditions are met.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
- If statements seem to be pretty broad on what they are used for is there a specific time they are not needed?
